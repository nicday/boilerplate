# Nic's Boilerplate
A special boilerplat just for me. This makes projects quicker to start and coveres some basic issues in cross browser compatibiliy.

## Notes:
- Based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
- Includes [SCSS for Foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation)
- Updated directory structure so assets are contained in the assets directory

## How to use this:
1. On the main repository page, click the 'download ZIP' button to get a ZIP file of the Boilerplate
2. Extract the ZIP file and rename the direcotry the ZIP file created to the name of the new project you want to start with the Boilerplate - this will be the project root directory
3. Move the project root directory from your Downloads direcoty to where you keep your projects
4. Start work on your new project...
